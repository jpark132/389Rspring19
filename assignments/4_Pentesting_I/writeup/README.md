## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

the flag is
CMSC389R{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}
to find the flag I used the inputs

nc 142.93.136.81 1337
142.93.136.81; ./bin/bash

from here I was granted access to a new bash shell and from there I was able to access the flag by going into the home directory and viewing the contents of the flag.txt file

I originally looked up what command injection was and how I could get access to the file system. I tried chaining commands together but they didn't work. Then I realized I could just open a new bash shell and from there I could run whatever commands I wanted.

One of the ways to fix the command injection would be to take inputs as string literals and sanitize the inputs as they came in for special characters like ; / . and others
### Part 2 (60 pts)

The stub.pay has 4 commands

Shell - this basically opens up a new bash shell in the unsecured computer and from there you can use the shell as you would any other linux terminal so basically spawning a new bash shell.
Simply type shell and it will spawn

pull - This will allow you to copy a file from the unsecure computer/server to your local directory. It will create a new file if it does not exist and will place it in the current directory
format is pull (full file path) (name of the new file)

help- will show a basic help screen showing the parameters of the commands and what they do

quit- exits the shell that you spawned.
