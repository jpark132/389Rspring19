### Part 2 (75 pts)

I believe that because I have found the bug and it could cause harm to users and the public I have a moral obligation to at least make an attempt to bring attention to the problem. In the words of Robert A. Jameson “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil was that good men should do nothing”. If I were to ignore it then I would feel responsible should something go wrong as I had the opportunity to prevent the disaster before anyone got hurt. My first plan of action would be to bring it to my supervisor or direct manager’s attention. As my superior it would then be his responsibility to bring attention to it to his fellow team members and deliberate on what to do. If the company decides to postpone and fix the issue then all is well. However, if the company decides to roll out the ECU to release then I would attempt to bring it up to a manager of a higher position to make sure it would be rolled out safely. At this point the responsibility is now shared as they all have heard about the bug with the ECU. At this point I’ve done my due diligence in attempting to fix the problem. If the ECU is still released on time then I would not be responsible for any of the complications as I have done what I could to bring it to the attention of my higher ups. It was their decision to roll it out despite my warnings and any harm that came from that should be their responsibility and theirs alone. This may seem rather reckless as the ECU is still rolled out with bugs and therefore some might say I still bear responsibility. However, the release was not my decision to make and I have done all in my power to try and postpone the release. If I had gone any further, such as by taking it public or to a consumer watchdog, I would have violated disclosure agreements and thus adversely affected both me and the company. Taking the problem to a regulatory organization such as the government however might solve this issue. By bringing the issue to an authority with higher power would be able to postpone the release without adversely affecting me as the company is still under jurisdiction of the US government.
